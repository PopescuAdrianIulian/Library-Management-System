   ```

2. **Import the project** into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

3. **Configure MySQL Database Connection**:
   - Set up a MySQL database and create a schema for the project.
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your database credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     spring.jpa.show-sql=true
     ```

4. **Run the Project**:
   You can run the application via your IDE or use the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Start exploring the Library Management System!**

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following endpoints:

### Admin Endpoints (Protected with Admin Role)
- **POST /admin/add**: Add a new book to the library
  - Request Body Example:
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Spring Boot for Beginners",
      "author": "John Doe",
      "availability": "AVAILABLE"
    }
    ```

- **PUT /admin/{id}**: Update an existing book by ID
  - Request Body Example:
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Spring Boot Advanced",
      "author": "Jane Doe",
      "availability": "AVAILABLE"
    }
    ```

- **DELETE /admin/book/{id}**: Delete a book by ID

- **DELETE /admin/loan/{id}**: Delete a loan by ID

### User Endpoints (Accessible by Users)
- **GET /user/list**: Get a list of all available books

- **POST /user/borrow/{bookId}/{name}**: Borrow a book by ID and user name
  - Example URL: `/user/borrow/1/John`

- **POST /user/return/{loanId}**: Return a borrowed book by loan ID

- **GET /user/loans/{loanId}**: Get loan details by loan ID

- **GET /user/loans/list**: Get a list of all loans

## Security Features

### Role-Based Authorization
- The application uses role-based authorization with two main roles:
  - **USER**: Allows borrowing and returning books, viewing loans.
  - **ADMIN**: Provides additional rights to add, update, and delete books, as well as manage loans.

### BCrypt Password Encoding
- User passwords are encoded using **BCrypt** for secure storage. This prevents plain-text passwords from being saved in the database, ensuring a higher level of security.

### Logging
- The application uses **SLF4J** with **Logback** to log important actions such as user logins, failed attempts, and other critical system operations. This helps in monitoring and troubleshooting the application.
